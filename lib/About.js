From cleaning your home to your everyday job or career they put their heart into it, and you can tell. The one person I admire the most would be my dad. As far as I can tell, he is the most hard working and loving individual, and never have I doubted that. If I can be just half as amazing as he is I know I can do great. My mission is to create beautiful, functional websites that will only get better as I grow as a developer."
